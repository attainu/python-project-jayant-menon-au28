# Jayant Menon's Maze Solver

### A Python 3 program that solves a maze. 
<br>

- takes .txt maze input
- outputs .txt solved maze 
- 1s represent clear space (can move)
- 0s represent blocked space (can't move)

Sample input: 

` 1100` <br>
  `1000`<br>
  `1100`<br>
  `1111`

Sample output:

`1000`<br>
`1000`<br>
`1000`<br>
`1111`<br>

## Installing and Running the program:

- clone this repo! 

- from the same folder, run: `python3 rat_maze.py -h` for a quick overview 

- Currently the program only supports input files in the .input folder, and outputs to the .output folder

- `-i inputfile.txt` and `-o outputfile.txt` provide the input and output arguments 

- `-a` flag lets you choose the algorithm: `BFS` or `DFS`
